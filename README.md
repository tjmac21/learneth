building a HelloWorld contract.
Testing It
Deploying it.

On Rinkeby
Rinkeby Faucet
P3. Complex Contract
Core concepts.
Arrays
Mappings
Bits
What does this mean?
a & b == b
(0x1 << 3) - 1
We will get you good at bits.
Testing, Deploying, Communicating.
P4. Solve the needing to update your contract
Things we will a bit complicated here. But it is a must for any developer.
